## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the **optimal layout** depending on their device's screen size (mobile: 375px / desktop: 1440px)
- See **hover and focus states** for all interactive elements
- **Open a lightbox gallery** by clicking the main product image (desktop only)
- **Navigate the lightbox** with previous/next buttons and thumbnail clicks
- **Switch the active image** via thumbnail clicks in both the main gallery and the lightbox
- **Adjust item quantity** with increment/decrement controls (minimum of 1)
- **Add items to the cart** and have the cart badge update with the total quantity
- **View the cart popover** by clicking the cart icon in the nav
- **Remove individual items** from the cart
- Toggle a **mobile slide-in navigation** with a backdrop overlay

### Design Reference

Design files are located in the [`/design`](./design/) directory, covering:

| File | Description |

## Features & Implementation

### Navigation & Mobile Menu

**Component:** [`src/components/Nav.jsx`](./src/components/Nav.jsx)

- Responsive navbar with logo, navigation links, cart icon, and avatar
- Mobile: hamburger button toggles a **slide-in drawer** with a semi-transparent backdrop
- Cart icon shows a **dynamic badge** with the total item count (hidden when cart is empty)
- Full keyboard support: `aria-expanded` on the menu button, `aria-hidden` on the backdrop
- The mobile drawer closes when clicking the backdrop overlay

```jsx
// aria-expanded keeps screen readers informed about menu state
<button aria-label={isMenuOpen ? "Close menu" : "Open menu"} aria-expanded={isMenuOpen}>
```

---

### Product Gallery & Lightbox

**Component:** [`src/components/Gallery.jsx`](./src/components/Gallery.jsx)

- Displays **4 product images** with corresponding thumbnails
- **Mobile:** Previous/Next arrow buttons navigate between images; lightbox is disabled
- **Desktop:** Clicking the main image opens a **lightbox modal** with full navigation
- Lightbox closes on backdrop click or the close button; navigation within the lightbox is independent
- Active thumbnail is visually highlighted with an orange border and overlay tint
- All nav buttons use `aria-label`; decorative images use `alt=""` to be skipped by screen readers

**State managed:**
```js
const [currentImageIndex, setCurrentImageIndex] = useState(0);
const [isLightboxOpen, setIsLightboxOpen] = useState(false);
```

---

### Product Description & Pricing

**Component:** [`src/components/Description.jsx`](./src/components/Description.jsx)

- Displays brand label, product title, and description text
- **Star rating** rendered dynamically from a numeric value (e.g. `4.5 → ★★★★½`)
- **Pricing block:** Shows discounted price, discount percentage badge, and struck-through original price
- **Quantity selector:** Increment/decrement buttons with a minimum of 1; quantity persists between interactions
- **Add to Cart button:** Fires the `onAddToCart(quantity)` callback and opens the cart

```js
// Discounted price calculation
const discountedPrice = product.originalPrice * (1 - product.discountPercent / 100);
```

Product data is defined as a plain object in [`App.jsx`](./src/App.jsx) and passed as a prop — making the component fully reusable with different products.

---

### Cart System

**Components:** [`App.jsx`](./src/App.jsx) (state) + [`Cart.jsx`](./src/components/Cart.jsx) (UI)

State lives in the root `App` component and is passed down via props — a classic **lifting state up** pattern.

**Cart logic (in `App.jsx`):**
- Adding an item that already exists **updates its quantity** instead of duplicating it
- Adding a new item **appends it** to the cart array
- Cart automatically **opens** when an item is added
- `cartCount` is derived via `.reduce()` — no redundant state

```js
const handleAddToCart = (quantity) => {
  setCartItems((currentItems) => {
    const existingItem = currentItems.find((item) => item.id === product.id);
    if (existingItem) {
      return currentItems.map((item) =>
        item.id === product.id ? { ...item, quantity } : item
      );
    }
    return [...currentItems, { id: product.id, name: product.title, unitPrice: discountedPrice, quantity }];
  });
  setIsCartOpen(true);
};
```

**Cart UI (`Cart.jsx`):**
- Displays as a **popover** anchored to the nav bar
- **Empty state:** "Your cart is empty." message
- **Filled state:** Item thumbnail, name, unit price × quantity = total, delete button, and checkout button
- Uses `role="dialog"` and `aria-hidden` to correctly communicate visibility to assistive technologies

## Accessibility

This project was built with accessibility as a first-class concern:

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Semantic HTML | `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<main>`, `<h1>`, `<h3>`, `<button>` |
| ARIA attributes | `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-current`, `role="dialog"` |
| Keyboard navigable | All interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard |
| Decorative images | Navigation arrows and icons use `alt=""` to be skipped by screen readers |
| Focus management | Native `<button>` elements used throughout (not `<div>` click handlers) |

---

## What I Learned

### Lifting State Up Cleanly

Managing cart state in `App.jsx` and passing handlers down as props kept each component focused on its own responsibility. `Gallery` only knows about images; `Description` only knows about quantity — cart logic stays centralized and predictable.

### Functional State Updates

Using the updater function form of `setState` (e.g. `setCartItems((current) => ...)`) avoids stale closure bugs when reads and writes to state happen in the same operation — particularly important in the add-to-cart handler.

### BEM for Component-Scoped CSS

BEM naming conventions (`.nav-filter__cart-button`, `.description__quantity-selector`) prevented style collisions across components without needing CSS Modules or a CSS-in-JS library.

### Accessible Interactive Elements

Using native `<button>` elements instead of styled `<div>` click handlers gave keyboard navigation and screen reader support essentially for free — a pattern worth internalizing early.

---

## Continued Development

Areas to improve in future projects:

- **TypeScript** — adding static types to prop interfaces and state shapes would catch errors earlier and improve editor tooling
- **CSS Custom Properties** — centralising the color palette and spacing scale into `:root` variables to reduce magic numbers scattered across component stylesheets
- **Focus trap in the lightbox** — the current implementation doesn't trap focus inside the modal, which is a WCAG 2.1 requirement for `role="dialog"` elements
- **Animated transitions** — smoother enter/exit animations on the cart popover, mobile menu, and lightbox using CSS transitions
- **Unit testing** — adding component tests with React Testing Library to validate cart logic and UI state transitions
